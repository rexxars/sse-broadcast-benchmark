# sse-broadcast, go implementation

## Installing

There are no dependencies apart from go itself. See [go - getting started](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Running

Simply execute `server`:

```
$ ./server
```

## Compiling

```
$ go build server.go
```

## Notes

I'm pretty new to go, so this might not be the most efficient implementation.

Port number is by default `1942`, but can be changed:

```
$ ./server <portNumber>
```
